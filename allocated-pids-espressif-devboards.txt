This file contains PIDs that are allocated to specific uses of Espressif-built hardware. If
you have a SDK or software that is intended to run on a bare Espressif devkit and you need
a PID, please request it by adding the PID to the end of this file. When adding a PID, make
sure to add it at the bottom of the list and use the next (hexadecimal) PID number so the list
stays sequential.
